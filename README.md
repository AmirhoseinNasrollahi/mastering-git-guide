A comprehensive yet concise **Git, GitHub, and GitLab guide** created after completing  
the **“Mastering Git, GitHub, and GitLab: Your Ultimate Guide to Version Control”** course (FaraDars, 2025).  

This repository represents the foundation of my future **MRI and PET medical image processing projects**,  
where version control and reproducibility are crucial for research integrity.

## 🧩 Why Git Matters in Medical Imaging Research

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of medical AI.  
Using **Git & GitHub** allows for:
- Transparent versioning of analysis scripts and datasets  
- Collaborative model development  
- Traceable documentation of image preprocessing and AI experiments

> _“If it’s not under version control, it doesn’t exist.”_
